### Value Semantics in C++

C++ treats variables of user-defined types with **value semantics**, meaning objects are implicitly copied in various contexts. It's crucial to understand what "copying an object" actually means.

Consider the example below:

```cpp
class Person {
    std::string name;
    int age;

public:
    Person(const std::string& name, int age) : name(name), age(age) {}
};

int main() {
    Person a("Bjarne Stroustrup", 60);
    Person b(a);  // Copy constructor is called
    b = a;        // Copy assignment operator is called
}
```

### Special Member Functions

Copying an object involves two scenarios: 
- **Copy Constructor**: `Person b(a);` creates a new object by copying an existing one.
- **Copy Assignment Operator**: `b = a;` assigns the state of an existing object to another, already constructed object.

If these special member functions (copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor) are not defined explicitly, C++ provides implicit definitions:

```cpp
// 1. Copy constructor
Person(const Person& that) : name(that.name), age(that.age) {}

// 2. Copy assignment operator
Person& operator=(const Person& that) {
    name = that.name;
    age = that.age;
    return *this;
}

// 3. Destructor
~Person() {}
```

### Managing Resources

Explicit definitions are needed when a class manages resources (e.g., dynamic memory). Consider a pre-standard C++ version of the `Person` class:

```cpp
class Person {
    char* name;
    int age;

public:
    Person(const char* the_name, int the_age) {
        name = new char[strlen(the_name) + 1];
        strcpy(name, the_name);
        age = the_age;
    }

    ~Person() { delete[] name; }
};
```

Using raw pointers can lead to issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers because the default copy constructor and assignment operator perform **shallow copies**.

### Deep Copy Example

To correctly manage resources, define a **deep copy**:

```cpp
// 1. Copy constructor
Person(const Person& that) {
    name = new char[strlen(that.name) + 1];
    strcpy(name, that.name);
    age = that.age;
}

// 2. Copy assignment operator
Person& operator=(const Person& that) {
    if (this != &that) {
        delete[] name;
        name = new char[strlen(that.name) + 1];
        strcpy(name, that.name);
        age = that.age;
    }
    return *this;
}
```

### Exception Safety

For exception safety in the copy assignment operator, use a local variable:

```cpp
Person& operator=(const Person& that) {
    char* local_name = new char[strlen(that.name) + 1];
    strcpy(local_name, that.name);
    delete[] name;
    name = local_name;
    age = that.age;
    return *this;
}
```

### Noncopyable Resources

Some resources (e.g., file handles, mutexes) should not be copied. In such cases, delete the copy constructor and assignment operator:

```cpp
Person(const Person& that) = delete;
Person& operator=(const Person& that) = delete;
```

### The Rule of Three, Five, and Zero

- **Rule of Three**: If you declare either a destructor, copy constructor, or copy assignment operator, you likely need to declare all three.
- **Rule of Five** (C++11+): Also include the move constructor and move assignment operator.
- **Rule of Zero**: When not managing resources manually, avoid writing any special member functions.

### Conclusion

Managing resources in C++ can be error-prone and complicated. Use standard library classes (e.g., `std::string`) that handle resource management for you, and follow the rules of three, five, or zero to avoid common pitfalls.
